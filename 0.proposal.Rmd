# Topic statement
a statement of the topic.


# Background

 background material that provides 
 motivation for the topic,
including a brief review of key literature.

What has been done to predict outcomes of court cases
- audio
-transripts
-interruptions
-how a judge votes before
-av has been a recent development (cite examples of people who have used it)
but this falls short of the potential of analysing judges facial expressions

The idea of facial expression

- paul ekman

examples of who has used it
tennis steph

formailsed facs

openface implements these ideas

other examples of people using openface for research



#data 
We have chosen to derive faces from video by using screenshots, this has been done for tennis (cite steph). 
- Stephs open face 
   Steph's paper (Department - comparing four API for face recognition)

what we will do with data:


# Aims
apply techniques in facial expression analysis to explore court proceedings

 An outline of the aims of your research.
- can we understand more about a judge

can we understand how they respond to apellant or respondent

understand how expressions change during a case, or are diferent between cases



# Plan  
A statement of your research plan
Timeline: Completed:

what data you will use if conducting empirical research; 
- use court videos, crop individual faces 

what econometric techniques you intend to apply;


Timeline: Intended

what theoretical results you intend to derive;



what techniques you will use to evaluate your results/methods and to compare them with other comparable results/methods in the
literature; and so on).
