### Can we predict the outcome of an appeal based on facial expressions on the Justices?

Early study predict using 

- Judge charcteristics: 

  - gender, 
  - religious background and 
  - political view. 

More recently

- on-court information:  

  - the use of language by judge, 
  - the facial expression by judge and 
  - voice by judge.

# Recent legal studies on judicial behaviour

- Tutton et al. (2018): 

  - The facial expressions of the judge were recorded manually when the videos were played. 
  
  - This observational approach of analysing videos could be  subjective when different people are observing the same videos

This motivates me to study the facial expression of the judge via an more objective approach by using facial recognition technology.

# Face Recognition


- **Paul Ekman** analysed facial actions and expressions, leading to the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)


- Decomposition of facial muscles
