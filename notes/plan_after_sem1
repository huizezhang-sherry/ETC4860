Judge characteristation - the normal expression for each justices 
the interesting information is to look at where each justices diviate form their normal expression

do some summary "statistics" for each justices when apellent/ respondent is speaking
may be divided it more to statment period and q&a period for both appenllent and respondent period 
a sentence summary for each justices


Edelman: 
concentrate when hand covering month and staring eyes 
maybe need to sample more if at a period there's more expression
maybe the last 10% of the video more expression for both appellent and respondent 

Bell: 
animated, askes questions
maybe look at what causes missing: cant detect + looking down 
extract those looking down as normal -> the ones we have records are the "abonormal -> interesting"

keane: 
grumpy 





maybe there's a way to sharpen the resolution -> from one pixel to two pixels 

maybe more vidoes of the justices -> bell gives a presentation -> compare with basement
