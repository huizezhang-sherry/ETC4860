p.1. How does  Kovalchik & Reid show the 'potential' to apply OpenFace to the Justices?  And you don't use it to predict outcomes


p. 6 - 'a full description of the output variables can be found here'. - where? 

How about regressing presence (of a facial expression) on dummies for each judge, dummies for the case + a dummy for whether the counsel for the appellant or respondent is speaking.

In a third model. take the  three or five most common AUs and teat AU1=1, AU2=1, AU14=1 etc as the dependent variable to see if there are differences across AUs

If you are worried about the dependent variable being skewed use RElogit: https://gking.harvard.edu/relogit
