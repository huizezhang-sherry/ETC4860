- put the current work into words: data structure for each analysis 
- find a way to dealing with missings 

bootstrap across/ within judge_id/ video_id/ AU - realise it and put into word
PCA judge_id/ video_id/ AU - mostly done

strength and weekness of the treatment

Penalsd LDA/ LASSO maybe in class variable - PCA

Todo: 
- clean up the `2.Magick & OpenFace` and `3.0csv_processing` - send di a copy of the data
- write up the most common: reference the text analysis
  - comparing should be the percentage within
- write up intensity [tick]


week 6:
1. fix initial boxplot to have the line ot the max + scaled plot for vis mean
2. write down math for the statistics computed in the presence and intensity plot
*. write up a similar paragraph for presence, like the intensity one
3. fix the data quality problem: `au_tidy`
4. refine the data structure math: y is multivariate 
5. more plots for 
- intensity 
- presence 
- intensity 2



6. modelling: 
- P_{ik}: GLM binomial link
- P_{ijk}
