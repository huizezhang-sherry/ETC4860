# The What, How, and Why of Wavelet Shrinkage Denoising

Should this noise removal take place in the original signal (time-space) domain or in a transform domain? If the latter, should it be the time-frequency domain via the Fourier transform or the time-scale domain via the wavelet transform?


Wavelet shrinkage denoising
   - not smoothing: removes high frequencies and retains low frequencies
   - it consists of three steps: 
    1) a linear forward wavelet transform, 
    2) a nonlinear shrinkage denoising, and 
    3) a linear inverse wavelet transform. B
  - non-parametric 
  
  
  
we expect one judge to have consistent behaviour across all the videos 

normal behavioural bcharacteristics of jduge - the 95% band across frame_id. 

mean_ind is the mean summarisation of one particular judge in one particular video and now we want to expand it across time

2. judges reaction
