 - Bonferroni correction:It is mainly useful when there are a fairly small number of multiple comparisons and you're looking for one or two that might be significant

- Second, when multiple independent hypotheses are tested, which usually is the case in a study or experiment, the risk that at least one of these tests will be false positive increases, above the nominal significance level, with the number of hypotheses tested

- Third, a statistically insignificant difference between two observed groups (the sample) does not indicate that this effect does not exist in the population from which the sample is taken .... A statistically insignificant outcome indicates nothing more than that the observed sample is too small to detect a population effect. A statistically insignificant outcome should be interpreted as “absence of evidence, not evidence of absence”6.

- Two means may well be statistically significantly different and still have somewhat overlapping confidence intervals. Overlapping confidence intervals can therefore not be directly interpreted in terms of statistical significance

- confidence intervals are often misunderstood as representing variability of observations instead of uncertainty of the sample estimate.

When significant: 
  - is significant 
  - not significant: a false positive - type one error 
When insignificant: 
  - truly insignificant 
  - significant: a false negative - type two error 
  
  
To increase power, thus reduce type two error - increase sample size 

Confidence interval as another way to explain the precision of sample statistics 

The advocacy of confidence interval estimation for presentation of results in scientific journals is not new [see, e.g. (Yates, 1951; Savage, 1957; Rozeboom, 1960; Gardner and Altman, 1986; Simon, 1986; Bulpitt, 1987)] 




Summary: 
- if you want to use p-value - has to deal with false positive and false negative rate with adjustment i.e. bonferroni correction

- better to use confidence interval to represent uncertainty of the sample estimates
