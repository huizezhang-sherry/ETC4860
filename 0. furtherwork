Projection Pursuit indices for time-based measurements

Motivation: 
When plenty of time series is available, it is hard for people to directly tell which one(s) are the most influential one(s). We use a method called project pursuit to find the most important/ influential time series among the given plenty of categories. 

Example 1: 
In my honours project, we have around time series data regarding to the action unit of each judge for each hearing. Using proejct pursuit, we are looking forwards to understand which few action unit are the most important in general and individual specific. 

Example 2: 
In economy, the Consumer Product Index(CPI) is a general result of plenty of consumer products. Currently, the government uses a  mean method to simply average the all the consumer products[need to be more specific about wording - do some readings!] to get teh CPI. This method doesnt reveal the relative importance of different consumer products in contributing to the CPI index and thus we use a method of project pursuit to find a suitable weight for each product to improve the accuracy of the CPI calculation.
