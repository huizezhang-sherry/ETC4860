# Results

## Notation

Let $\mathbf{X}$ be a matrix of predictors, and $\mathbf{Y}$ variable in our case is bivariate matrix of response variables, including a binary indicator of presence/absence and a numeric value measuring intensity, of facial action unit, where 

- $X_1$ indicates `judge_id` with six categories $i = 1,2, \cdots, 6$
- $X_2$ indicates `video_id` for each of the seven cases, $j = 1,2, \cdots, 7$
- $X_3$ indicates action unit containing `r length(unique(au_tidy$AU))` possible facial expression.  
- $X_4$ indicates `speaker`, either the appellant or respondent, $l=1,2$
- $X_5$ indicates `frame_id` corresponding to time, $t = 1,2, \cdots, T_j$

Note that $t$ could be considered a time variable, but because images are taken at 1 minute intervals, temporal dependence is unlikely to exist. Rather this should be considered an independent observation. 

A full, main effects model for the data might be expressed as:

$$Y_{ijkl} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \gamma_k + \delta_l + \varepsilon_{ijkl}$$ 

\noindent and we would be interested in interactions between judge, case, action unit and who is speaking. An alternative model structure, is to treat each action unit individually, and fit separate models. 

Also, let $P_{jitkl}$ represent the response variable presence, and $I_{jitkl}$ represent the second response variable intensity. This notation will be helpful for defining the plots and models explained in this section.

<!--
CP_2(\alpha_i, \beta_j, \gamma_t, \delta_k) + CP_3(\alpha_i, \beta_j, \gamma_t, \delta_k)$$

where 

- $CP_2$ is the all possible interaction of the two variables
- $CP_3$ is the all possible interaction of the three variables

## Action unit: Presence
 
 
### Mean presence 

I first compute the average presence ($P_{ik}$) of each action unit for each judge as $$P_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{jt}X_{ijtk}}{\sum_{j = 1}^JT_j}$$ This is then plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mean_presence} to give an overview of the presence of all the action units across all the judge. The order of action unit on the y axis is ranked by the average presence of all the judge. The five most frequent action units are highlighted in blue for each judge and summarised in Table \ref{tab:most_common}

```{r fig.cap="The average presence score of each action unit for each judge, aggregating on video and time. \\label{fig:mean_presence}"}
# Because each judge has different numbers of frame available, mean is a better way ,than sum/ count,  to discribe the frequency of occurence. 

most_common <- au_tidy %>% 
  group_by(judge_id,AU) %>% 
  summarise(avg_presence = mean(presence)) %>% 
  filter(avg_presence != "NaN") %>% 
  group_by(judge_id) %>% 
  arrange(-avg_presence) %>% 
  mutate(common = row_number()) %>% 
  mutate(most_common = as_factor(ifelse(common <=5, 1, 0))) %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU))

most_common %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =  fct_reorder(AU, avg_presence), y = avg_presence,
         fill = most_common, col = most_common)) + 
  geom_col() +
  xlab("AU") + 
  ylab("Average Presence") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(judge_id)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(most_common %>% 
  filter(most_common ==1) %>% 
  select(c(judge_id, AU)) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(judge_id, AU), 
  caption = "\\label{tab:most_common}The five most commonly presented action unit for each judge."
  )
```

It can be seen that some of the action units are common across almost all the judges, these includes 

- AU02 (outer eyebrow raise), 
- AU20 (lip stretcher), 
- AU15 (Lip Corner Depressor) 
- AU14 (Dimpler)

AU02 makes a contribution to surprise, which is a positive attitude showing that judges are interested in a particular moment [@ekman2002facial]. According to [@ekman2002facial], AU14 indicates boredom and AU15 shows confusion. Along with other action units that presented with high frequency in a particular judge but not all (summarised in Table \ref{tab:other_highf}), the emotions judges displayed in the courtroom can be summarised into three categories, described in Table \ref{tab:three_category} along with the featured action units. 


```{r}
tibble::tibble(emotion = c("Surprise", "Boredom", "Confusion"), 
       `Featured Action Unit` = c("AU01, AU02, AU05", 
                                  "AU14, AU23", 
                                  "AU07, AU15, AU23")) %>% 
  kable(caption = "\\label{tab:three_category} Summarised emotions and featured action units")
```



```{r}
other_highf <- most_common %>% 
  filter(most_common ==1) %>% 
  select(-c(common, most_common, avg_presence, Muscle)) %>% 
  filter(!AU %in% c("AU02", "AU20", "AU15", "AU14")) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
  select(-AU) %>% 
  spread(index, AU_meaning) %>% 
  rename(first = `1`, second = `2`, third = `3`)

knitr::kable(other_highf, caption = "\\label{tab:other_highf} Other high frequent action units ")
```




### Model fit

The first model I use is a generalised linear model with binomial link to understand the presence of the action units. The variables used include the judge_id, action units that appear in Table \ref{tab:most_common} and interactions. The model can be written down as Equation \ref{eq:judge_au}.Judge Edelman and AU25 are selected as the base level.  Estimated coefficients of the model can be found in the Appendix and model fitting result is in Table \ref{tab:glance_1}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:judge_au}
P_{ik} = \mu + \alpha_i + \delta_k + (\alpha\delta)_{ik}
\end{equation}


```{r}
most_common_au <- most_common %>% 
  ungroup(judge_id) %>% 
  group_by(AU) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(avg_presence)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean) %>% 
  top_n(7)

au_model <- au_tidy %>% 
  ungroup(judge_id) %>% 
  filter(AU %in% most_common_au$AU) %>% 
  mutate(judge_id = fct_relevel(judge_id, "Edelman"), 
         AU = fct_relevel(AU, "AU25"))

binomial_model <- glm(presence ~ (.-frame_id-speaker-intensity-video_id)^2, 
           family = binomial(link = "logit"),  data = au_model) %>% 
  step(trace = FALSE)

glance(binomial_model) %>% kable(caption = "\\label{tab:glance_1}summary of model fit")
#tidy(binomial_model) %>% kable(digits=2)

au_model_1_aug <- augment(binomial_model, au_model)
#ggplot(au_model_1_aug, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()

#summary(binomial_model)
```

### Presence by videos

Apart from visualising the general presence score for all the action unit, I'm also interested in the break down statistics by video ($P_{ijk}$). This is computed as $$P_{ijk} = \frac{\sum_{t}X_{ijtk}}{T_j}$$ for the four most common action units: AU02, AU14, AU15, AU20 and plotted in Figure \ref{common_video}. From this plot, we can observe that some of the judge are have relatively stable display of action unit throughout different videos (i.e. Edelman and Nettle), while Gagaler seems to be highly reactive to some cases (i.e. OKS). 

```{r fig.cap="Average presence of the four most common action units for each judge by video\\label{fig:common_video}"}
most_common_subset <- most_common %>% 
  filter(most_common == 1) %>% 
  mutate(index = paste0(judge_id,AU))
  
more_presence <- au_tidy %>% 
  group_by(judge_id,AU, video_id) %>% 
  summarise(avg_presence = mean(presence)) %>% 
  filter(avg_presence != "NaN") %>% 
  arrange(-avg_presence) %>% 
  mutate(index = paste0(judge_id,AU)) %>% 
  filter(index %in% most_common_subset$index) %>% 
  ungroup(judge_id) %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU))
  
more_presence %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = video_id, y = avg_presence, 
             group = judge_id, col = judge_id)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(AU_meaning),scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

```

### Model fit




\begin{equation}\label{eq:judge_au_video}
P_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j +\delta_k + (\alpha\beta)_{ij}+(\alpha\delta)_{ik} + (\beta\delta)_{jk}
\end{equation}

```{r}

binomial_model_2 <- glm(presence ~ (.-frame_id-speaker-intensity)^2, 
           family = binomial(link = "logit"),  data = au_model) %>% 
  step(trace = FALSE)

glance(binomial_model_2) %>% kable(caption = "\\label{tab:glance_2}summary of model fit")

#tidy(binomial_model_2) %>% kable(digits=2)

#au_model_2_aug <- augment(binomial_model_2, au_model)

# binomial_model_2 <- glm(presence ~ judge_id + AU + video_id +
#         judge_id*AU + AU*video_id + judge_id*video_id, 
#            family = "binomial",  data = au_model) %>% 
#   step(trace = FALSE)
# 
# summary(binomial_model_2)
# tidy(binomial_model_2)
# glance(binomial_model_2)

```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(au_model_2_aug, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

### Appellant vs. Respondent 

```{r}
binomial_model_3 <- glm(presence ~ judge_id + AU + video_id + speaker + 
        judge_id*AU + AU*video_id + judge_id*video_id + AU*video_id*speaker , 
           family = "binomial",  data = au_model)

glance(binomial_model_3) %>% kable(caption = "\\label{tab:glance_3}summary of model fit")
#tidy(binomial_model_3) %>% kable(digits=2)
```

## Action unit: Intensity

### General Intensity  plot

In Ekman's 20002 FACS manual, the intensity of an action unit is defined based on five classes: Trace: 0-1, Slight: 1-2, Marked or pronounced: 2-3, Severe or extreme: 3-4 and Maximum: 4-5. 

The boxplot of the intensity for all the judges across all the videos is presented in Figure \ref{fig:intensity}. Each bar-and-whisker represents the intensity ($I_{ijtk}$) of all the action units aggregated on time for a particular judge $i$ in a specific case $j$. For example, the first bar-and-whisker in case Nauru_a is created using all the 17 action units of Edelman through out the elapsed time in Nauru_a case.

From the plot, we can see that most of the action units have low intensity score and this is expected because usually judges are expected to behave neutral in the court room. Thus a square root transformation is taken on the y axis for better visualisation effect. We can find that Judge Nettle seems to have higher average in all the four cases he appears: Nauru_a&b, Rinehart_a &b. 

```{r fig.cap="General intensity score by judge and video\\label{fig:intensity}"}
au_intensity_all <- au_tidy %>% 
  mutate(is_intense = ifelse(intensity >= 2, 1, 0))  

# intensity plot
#au_intensity_all %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(x = judge_id, y = intensity, color = judge_id)) + 
#  geom_boxplot() + 
#  facet_wrap(vars(video_id), scales = "free_x") + 
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1), 
#        legend.position = "none")

# the plot magnify the box
au_intensity_all %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = judge_id, y = intensity, color = judge_id)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef = 100) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(video_id), scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_sqrt()

``` 
 
### Mean intensity 

Mean intensity score ($I_{ik}$) of each action unit for each of the judge is computed as $$I_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{jt}X_{ijtk}}{\sum_{j = 1}^JT_j}$$ and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mean_intensity}. The five most intense action units for each judge are presented in Table \ref{tab:most_intense}. We can find that the common high intense action units includes 

```{r}
# include_graphics("figures/AU20-lip-stretcher.gif", dpi = 128)
# include_graphics("figures/AU7-lid-tightener.gif")
# include_graphics("figures/AU4-brow-lowerer.gif")
```

- AU20 (Lip Stretcher)
- AU07 (Lid Tightener)
- AU04 (Brow Lowerer)

AU04 also belongs to the confusion category as AU07. This could help to understand that judges are more likely to express a stronger confusing expression than other emotions. 


```{r fig.cap="Mean intensity score for each judge and action unit aggregating on videos.\\label{fig:mean_intensity}"}
most_intense <- au_intensity_all %>% 
  filter(!AU == "AU28") %>%  # AU28 doesnt have intensity score
  group_by(judge_id, AU) %>% 
  summarise(mean_intensity = mean(intensity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean_intensity) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number(), 
         most_intense = as.factor(ifelse(index <= 5, 1,0))) 

most_intense%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(AU, mean_intensity), 
             y = mean_intensity, 
             fill = most_intense)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(judge_id)) + 
  coord_flip()
```  
 


```{r}
knitr::kable(most_intense %>% 
  filter(most_intense ==1) %>% 
  select(c(judge_id, AU)) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(judge_id, AU), caption = "\\label{tab:most_intense}The five most intense action unit for each judge.")
```
 
 
### Intensity plot for the most frequent action units
 
Apart from visualising the general intensity score for all the action units, I'm also interested in the intensity score of the most frequent action units. Figure \ref{fig:intensity_by_au} presents this. The statistics being plotted is $I_{ijtk}$ with $k$ including AU02, AU14, AU15 and AU20 as the most common four action units. From this plot, we can learn that AU02, although being commonly detected for all the judges, has low intensity score. 


```{r fig.cap = "Intensity score of the most frequent action units, seperating by judge and video ID.\\label{fig:intensity_by_au}"}

# plot for four major high frequent action units
au_intensity_all %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU)) %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = video_id, y = intensity, col = video_id)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(AU_meaning),
             cols = vars(judge_id), scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

# plot for other high frequent action units
# intensity_subset_plot <- function(judge){
#   intensity_subset %>% 
#     filter(!AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
#     filter(judge_id == judge) %>% 
#     ggplot(aes(x = video_id, y = intensity, col = video_id)) + 
#     geom_boxplot() + 
#     facet_grid(rows = vars(judge_id),
#                cols = vars(AU), scales = "free_x") + 
#     ylim(c(0,4)) + 
#     theme(legend.position = "none",
#           axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
# }
# 
#   
# judge <- unique(intensity_subset$judge_id)
# subplot <- map(judge, intensity_subset_plot)  
# 
# 
# ggarrange(subplot[[1]], 
#           subplot[[2]],
#           subplot[[5]],
#           subplot[[6]],
#           subplot[[3]],
#           subplot[[4]],
#           ncol = 2, nrow = 3)

```
 
### High intensity points

We filter out the points have intensity greater than 2  (at least "slight" as per Ekman) in the previous plot and plot it against time and color by the speaker. It tells us that Edelman, Gageler and Nettle are the judges have stronger emotion that can be detected (since they have more points with intensity greater than 2). Different judges also have different time where they display stronger emotions. For example, Justice Nettle are more likely to have stronger emotion throughout the time when the appellant is speaking but only at the beginning and ending period when the respondent is speaking.

```{r}
au_intensity_all %>% filter(is_intense ==1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = frame_id, y = intensity, col = speaker)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(judge_id))
```
