# Acknowledgements {-}

I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Di Cook, my supervisors, for detailed guidance and kindness support throughout and Professor Russell Smyth for raising the idea of this project. I would like to appreciate Stephanie Kobakian, with whom I have countless discussion with about the project. I would also like to extend my thank to my friends, colleagues and family for standing behind me unconditionally.
