## Action unit: Presence


### Mean presence 

I first compute the average presence ($P_{ik}$) of each action unit for each judge as $$P_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{jt}X_{ijtk}}{\sum_{j = 1}^JT_j}$$ This is then plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mean_presence} to give an overview of the presence of all the action units across all the judge. The order of action unit on the y axis is ranked by the average presence of all the judge. The five most frequent action units are highlighted in blue for each judge and summarised in Table \ref{tab:most_common}

```{r fig.cap="The average presence score of each action unit for each judge, aggregating on video and time. \\label{fig:mean_presence}"}
# Because each judge has different numbers of frame available, mean is a better way ,than sum/ count,  to discribe the frequency of occurence. 

most_common <- au_tidy %>% 
  group_by(judge,AU) %>% 
  summarise(avg_presence = mean(presence)) %>% 
  filter(avg_presence != "NaN") %>% 
  group_by(judge) %>% 
  arrange(-avg_presence) %>% 
  mutate(common = row_number()) %>% 
  mutate(most_common = as_factor(ifelse(common <=5, 1, 0))) %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU))

most_common %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =  fct_reorder(AU, avg_presence), y = avg_presence,
             fill = most_common, col = most_common)) + 
  geom_col() +
  xlab("AU") + 
  ylab("Average Presence") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(judge)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(most_common %>% 
               filter(most_common ==1) %>% 
               dplyr::select(judge, AU) %>% 
               mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
               spread(judge, AU), 
             caption = "\\label{tab:most_common}The five most commonly presented action unit for each judge.")
```

It can be seen that some of the action units are common across almost all the judges, these includes 

- AU02 (outer eyebrow raise), 
- AU20 (lip stretcher), 
- AU15 (Lip Corner Depressor) 
- AU14 (Dimpler)

According to @ekman2002facial, AU02 makes a contribution to surprise, which is a positive attitude showing that judges are interested in a particular moment. AU14 indicates boredom and AU15 shows confusion. Along with other action units that presented with high frequency in a particular judge but not all (summarised in Table \ref{tab:other_highf}), the emotions judges displayed in the courtroom can be summarised into three categories, described in Table \ref{tab:three_category} along with the featured action units. 


```{r}
tibble::tibble(emotion = c("Surprise", "Boredom", "Confusion"), 
               `Featured Action Unit` = c("AU01, AU02, AU05", 
                                          "AU14, AU23", 
                                          "AU07, AU15, AU23")) %>% 
  kable(caption = "\\label{tab:three_category} Summarised emotions and featured action units")
```


```{r}
other_highf <- most_common %>% 
  filter(most_common ==1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(common, most_common, avg_presence, Muscle)) %>% 
  filter(!AU %in% c("AU02", "AU20", "AU15", "AU14")) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-AU) %>% 
  spread(index, AU_meaning) %>% 
  rename(first = `1`, second = `2`, third = `3`)

knitr::kable(other_highf, caption = "\\label{tab:other_highf} Other high frequent action units ")
```


```{r}
most_common_au <- most_common %>% 
  ungroup(judge) %>% 
  group_by(AU) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(avg_presence)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean) %>% 
  top_n(7)

model_dt <- au_tidy %>% 
  ungroup(judge) %>% 
  mutate(judge = fct_relevel(judge, "Edelman"), 
         AU = fct_relevel(AU, "AU01")) 
```


### Interaction between judge and action unit

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test result in Table \ref{tab:anova} shows that there are significant variance for both judge, AU and their interactions and thus it is necessary to perform multiple comparison to determine how does each level of action unit differ for different judges. The estimated coefficient for each judge and AU pair is reported in Table \ref{tab:result_1} along with the upper and lower confidence interval bond. This result is also plotted in Figure \ref{fig:model_1_plot} for visual inspection.


<!-- The information in the group column is helpful to understand how one particular pair of judge and au is different from another pair. With compact letter display, the pair with the same letter/number are *NOT* significantly different from each other.  -->



```{r model_1}
model_dt_1 <- model_dt %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU20", "AU15","AU14"))

binomial_model_1 <- glm(presence ~ judge*AU, 
                        family = binomial(link = "logit"),  
                        data = model_dt_1)

emmean_obj_1 <-  emmeans(binomial_model_1, ~judge*AU, type = "response")
int_1 <- confint(emmean_obj_1, adjust = "bonferroni")

# result_1 <- multcomp::cld(lsmean_obj_1, alpha = 0.05, type = "response") 
```

  filter(!is.na(df)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= fct_relevel(AU, c("AU20", "AU15", "AU14", "AU02")), 
             y = prob, fill = AU)) +

```


### Presence by videos

Apart from visualising the general presence score for all the action units, I'm also interested in the break down statistics by video ($P_{ijk}$). This is computed as $$P_{ijk} = \frac{\sum_{t}X_{ijtk}}{T_j}$$ for the four most common action units: AU02, AU14, AU15, AU20 and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:common_video}. From this plot, we can observe that Gageler and Bell seems to have a larger fluctuation across videos than others, especially for case OKS. This "visual" difference is only a preliminary result we observe from the plot, more solid statistical method need to be employed to validate the fluctuation shows statistical difference.


```{r fig.cap="Average presence of the four most common action units for each judge by video\\label{fig:common_video}"}
more_presence <- au_tidy %>% 
  group_by(judge,AU, video) %>% 
  summarise(avg_presence = mean(presence)) %>% 
  filter(avg_presence != "NaN") %>% 
  arrange(-avg_presence) %>% 
  ungroup(judge) %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU))

more_presence %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = video, y = avg_presence, 
             group = judge, col = judge)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(AU_meaning),scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
```

### Interaction between judge and video

The estimated coefficients for the second model are presented in Table \ref{tab:result_2} in the Appendix. Visual representation of the estimated result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:model_2_plot}. We can observe that Judge Edelman, Keane and Kiefel behave relatively consistent throughout all the videos since all the intervals for the same judge, same action unit but different videos overlaps after bonferroni adjustment. This would indicates in these videos, these judges would have similar thinking or reaction towards the evidence and argument presented by the barristers.  

Judge Gageler seems to have a large fluctuate of his facial expressions in video OKS and his response is significantly different from those in other cases for AU15 and AU20. This shows consistency with our exploratory data analysis where Gageler tends to show a higher proportion of presence for action units in case OKS. 

Our result validates the exploratory data analysis that the difference between case OKS and Parkes for Bell are significant in action unit 14, 15 and 20. Since the confidence interval doesn't overlap for these two videos. The difference between case McKell and OKS are not significance after the Bonferroni adjustment and this indicates the difference we see before in Figure \ref{fig:common_video} is more likely due to randomness rather than the true underlying difference between the two videos. From a legal perspective, this would show that Bell is addressing the cases with different responses. However, this different approach of responding by the judge doesn't indicate the biasness of the judge in the courtroom but the individuality of different judge approaching to cases. 


```{r model_2, results = "asis"}
model_dt_2 <- model_dt %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU20","AU15")) 

binomial_model_2 <- glm(presence ~ judge*video + judge*AU + video*AU, 
                        family = binomial(link = "logit"),  
                        data = model_dt_2)

emmean_obj_2 <- emmeans(binomial_model_2, c("judge", "video", "AU"), 
                         type = "response") 

int_2 <- confint(emmean_obj_2, adjust = "bonferroni")
```

```{r fig.cap="This is the graphical representaion for model 2\\label{fig:model_2_plot}"}
int_2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(df)) %>% 
  mutate(judge = fct_relevel(judge, c("Edelman", "Keane", "Kiefel", "Nettle", "Gageler", "Bell"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= fct_relevel(video, c("Nauru_a", "Nauru_b", "Rinehart_a",
                               "Rinehart_b", "McKell", "OKS", "Parkes")), 
                            y = prob,  group = judge)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col= video)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL, col= video), 
                width = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(AU ~ judge, scales = "free") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) + 
  xlab("video")
```      


```{r}
#ggplot(au_model_2_aug, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

### Interaction between judge and speaking parties

The estimated coefficients are presented in Table \ref{tab:result_3} and we could find from Figure \ref{fig:model_3_plot} that the video-wise difference between judge still persist and the speaker-wise difference is not significant even before bomferroni adjustment. This result would be a validation that on the high court level, the judges are behaving impartial to different speaking parties. 
  

```{r model_3, results = "asis"}
model_dt_3 <- model_dt %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU20","AU15")) 

binomial_model_3 <- glm(presence ~ judge*speaker + video*judge + AU*judge + video*AU, family = "binomial",  data = model_dt_3)

emmean_obj_3 <-  emmeans(binomial_model_3, 
                         c("judge", "video", "AU", "speaker") , 
                         type = "response")

int_3 <- confint(emmean_obj_3,  adjust = "bonferroni")
```

```{r fig.cap = "THis is the graphical representation of model3\\label{fig:model_3_plot}"}
int_3 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(df)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= fct_relevel(video, c("Nauru_a", "Nauru_b", "Rinehart_a",
                               "Rinehart_b", "McKell", "OKS", "Parkes")), 
             y = prob, col = speaker)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL), width = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(AU ~ fct_relevel(judge, c("Edelman", "Keane", "Kiefel", "Nettle", "Gageler", "Bell")), scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) + 
  xlab("video")
```


## Action unit: Intensity

### General Intensity  plot

In Ekman's 20002 FACS manual, the intensity of an action unit is defined based on five classes: Trace: 0-1, Slight: 1-2, Marked or pronounced: 2-3, Severe or extreme: 3-4 and Maximum: 4-5. 

The boxplot of the intensity for all the judges across all the videos is presented in Figure \ref{fig:intensity}. Each bar-and-whisker represents the intensity ($I_{ijtk}$) of all the action units aggregated on time for a particular judge $i$ in a specific case $j$. For example, the first bar-and-whisker in case Nauru_a is created using all the 17 action units of Edelman through out the elapsed time in Nauru_a case.

From the plot, we can see that most of the action units have low intensity score and this is expected because usually judges are expected to behave neutral in the court room. Thus a square root transformation is taken on the y axis for better visualisation effect. We can find that Judge Nettle seems to have higher average in all the four cases he appears: Nauru_a&b, Rinehart_a &b. 

```{r fig.cap="General intensity score by judge and video\\label{fig:intensity}"}
au_intensity_all <- au_tidy %>% 
  mutate(is_intense = ifelse(intensity >= 2, 1, 0))  

# intensity plot
#au_intensity_all %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(x = judge, y = intensity, color = judge)) + 
#  geom_boxplot() + 
#  facet_wrap(vars(video), scales = "free_x") + 
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1), 
#        legend.position = "none")

# the plot magnify the box
au_intensity_all %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = judge, y = intensity, color = judge)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef = 100) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(video), scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_sqrt()

``` 
 
### Mean intensity 

Mean intensity score ($I_{ik}$) of each action unit for each of the judge is computed as $$I_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{jt}X_{ijtk}}{\sum_{j = 1}^JT_j}$$ and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mean_intensity}. The five most intense action units for each judge are presented in Table \ref{tab:most_intense}. We can find that the common high intense action units includes 

```{r}
# include_graphics("figures/AU20-lip-stretcher.gif", dpi = 128)
# include_graphics("figures/AU7-lid-tightener.gif")
# include_graphics("figures/AU4-brow-lowerer.gif")
```

- AU20 (Lip Stretcher)
- AU07 (Lid Tightener)
- AU04 (Brow Lower)

AU04 also belongs to the confusion category as AU07. This could help to understand that judges are more likely to express a stronger confusing expression than other emotions. 


```{r fig.cap="Mean intensity score for each judge and action unit aggregating on videos.\\label{fig:mean_intensity}"}
most_intense <- au_intensity_all %>% 
  filter(!AU == "AU28") %>%  # AU28 doesnt have intensity score
  group_by(judge, AU) %>% 
  summarise(mean_intensity = mean(intensity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean_intensity) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number(), 
         most_intense = as.factor(ifelse(index <= 5, 1,0))) 

most_intense%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(AU, mean_intensity), 
             y = mean_intensity, 
             fill = most_intense)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(judge)) + 
  coord_flip()
```  
 


```{r}
knitr::kable(most_intense %>% 
  filter(most_intense ==1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(judge, AU)) %>% 
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(judge, AU), caption = "\\label{tab:most_intense}The five most intense action unit for each judge.")
```
 
### Model fit 

```{r eval = FALSE}
model_dt %>% 
  filter(intensity != 0)%>% 
  mutate(intensity = sqrt(intensity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = intensity)) + 
  geom_histogram()

model_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sqrt(intensity))) + 
  geom_histogram()

model_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = intensity)) + 
  geom_histogram()

# square root transformation
model_dt %>% mutate(intensity = (intensity - mean(intensity))/sd(intensity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = intensity)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```



### Intensity plot for the most frequent action units
 
Apart from visualising the general intensity score for all the action units, I'm also interested in the intensity score of the most frequent action units. Figure \ref{fig:intensity_by_au} presents this. The statistics being plotted is $I_{ijtk}$ with $k$ including AU02, AU14, AU15 and AU20 as the most common four action units. From this plot, we can learn that AU02, although being commonly detected for all the judges, has low intensity score. 


```{r fig.cap = "Intensity score of the most frequent action units, seperating by judge and video ID.\\label{fig:intensity_by_au}"}

# plot for four major high frequent action units
au_intensity_all %>% 
  left_join(au_meaning, by = c("AU" = "AU_number")) %>% 
  mutate(AU = as.factor(AU)) %>% 
  filter(AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = video, y = intensity, col = video)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(AU_meaning),
             cols = vars(judge), scales = "free_x") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

# plot for other high frequent action units
# intensity_subset_plot <- function(judge){
#   intensity_subset %>% 
#     filter(!AU %in% c("AU02", "AU14", "AU15", "AU20")) %>% 
#     filter(judge == judge) %>% 
#     ggplot(aes(x = video, y = intensity, col = video)) + 
#     geom_boxplot() + 
#     facet_grid(rows = vars(judge),
#                cols = vars(AU), scales = "free_x") + 
#     ylim(c(0,4)) + 
#     theme(legend.position = "none",
#           axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
# }
# 
#   
# judge <- unique(intensity_subset$judge)
# subplot <- map(judge, intensity_subset_plot)  
# 
# 
# ggarrange(subplot[[1]], 
#           subplot[[2]],
#           subplot[[5]],
#           subplot[[6]],
#           subplot[[3]],
#           subplot[[4]],
#           ncol = 2, nrow = 3)

```
 
### High intensity points

We filter out the points have intensity greater than 2  (at least "slight" as per Ekman) in the previous plot and plot it against time and color by the speaker. It tells us that Edelman, Gageler and Nettle are the judges have stronger emotion that can be detected (since they have more points with intensity greater than 2). Different judges also have different time where they display stronger emotions. For example, Justice Nettle are more likely to have stronger emotion throughout the time when the appellant is speaking but only at the beginning and ending period when the respondent is speaking.

```{r}
au_intensity_all %>% filter(is_intense ==1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = frame, y = intensity, col = speaker)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(judge))
```
