# Abstract {-}

Decisions by courtroom Justices have been discussed broadly in the legal literature. Gender, political views and religious background of both the Justices and counsel in the case potentially influence the decisions. This paper will explore the facial behaviour of the Justices during hearings with the objective of being to assess whether it can help to predict outcomes. Audio Visual(AV) recordings and case transcripts will be computationally processed and analysed to examine the decisions of each Justice.
