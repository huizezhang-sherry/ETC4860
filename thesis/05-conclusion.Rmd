# Conclusion

[INLCUDE CONCLUSION HERE]


## Limitation

I will now briefly discuss some of the limitation of this work. The current image frames are extracted at every one minute interval. However, some facial expressions may only last for a few second. Thus more frequent time interval could be used for getting more precise facial information of the judges. Also, if videos of the high court hearing could be accepted as input for facial expression detection, the potential correlation of emotion could be captured even better. 

In my work, seven videos are being processed into the facial recognition software and more videos could be processed to get more robust results. The reason for not processing more videos in the current study is  because the resolution of publicly available videos from the high court has only 720 pixels while the facial recognition software, OpenFace requires at least 30 pixels for a face to be detected. This means that we have to choose videos where three or five judges are presented. 

However, this work has established a workflow for extracting facial expressions of human from videos. As long as more higher resolution videos are available, facial variables can be extracted via the same fashion. 

## Future work

In the future, more work could be done to extract facial expressions of the Justices from videos using OpenFace. This could enable the researchers to capture more precise expression of the judges. However, as the extraction becomes more frequent, the problem of serial correlation could rise and appropriate modelling technique should be utilised to accommodate for this feature of data.
